# Word Ladder
## About
Word Ladder is a python program that solves 4-letter word ladders in a given number of moves(if possible).
## Pre Setup
1. Verify that python is set up locally by opening your Terminal and typing python and checking if an interactive shell shows up.
You should get something like this:
```
Python 2.7.12 |Anaconda 4.1.1 (x86_64)| (default, Jul  2 2016, 17:43:17) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2336.11.00)] on darwin

```

## Setup
1. download the .zip of this project.
2. unzip the file into a directory
3. open Terminal and ```cd``` to the directory.

## Using the Program
There are two ways to run the program
Method one:
1. type ```python word_ladder.py``` into your terminal
2. press enter
3. The program will default to using 'cool' as the start word and 'warm' as the end word. It will find answers of length 6 or less.
Method two:
1. type ```python word_ladder.py``` and then your desired start word, end word, and maximum length of the answer.
Example: ```python word_ladder.py hate love 5```
In the example above, the start word is 'hate', the end word is 'love', and the maximum length is 5.
2. press enter
